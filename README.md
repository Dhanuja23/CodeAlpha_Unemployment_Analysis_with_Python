# CodeAlpha_Unemployment_Analysis_with_Python
Unemployment is measured by the unemployment rate which is the number of people who are unemployed as a percentage of the total labour force. Hence in this project we analyze the unemployment rate using python.
Unemployment Rate Analysis  

This project analyzes **unemployment rates** using a dataset and visualizes trends over time. We use Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to find unemployment patterns.

Features  
 Reads unemployment data from a CSV file  
 Cleans and processes the data using **Pandas**  
 Visualizes trends using **Matplotlib & Seaborn**  
 Identifies patterns in unemployment rates  

 Dataset Information

-  **Region** - Name of the location  
-  **Date** - Month and year of the record  
-  **Unemployment Rate** - Percentage of unemployed people
